Data Analytics Project: 
Certificate:- https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/X43JCCW2MDZK

This repository is mainly for projects I have done under Coursera.

Coursera's online Google Data Analytics Course prepares me for a career as a data analyst by helping me 
learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly
 communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Excel, R-language, SQL, Python, and its data 
analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib,seaborn,sklearn) as I build a portfolio of projects.

Tips: For data science projects with R, I would recommend you to install tidyverse, ggplot2, lubridate, 
tidyr, dplyr and lots more... these basic libraries.

The program prepares me for a career as a Data Analyst / Analytics professional by helping me learn:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
  - Data Wrangling.
  - Statistics/Central Tendency
  - Data Analysis.
  - Data Visualization.

Technical Skill Utilized:-
 
  - R-programming Language.
  - Data Analysis libraries of R(tidyverse,readr,dplyr,readxl).
  - Data Visualization libraries (ggplot2,GGally,Lattice,plotly).
  - IBM Watson Studio (R)
