## Visualizing data:
```{r}
ggplot(data=Activity,aes(x=TotalSteps,y=Calories,color=Calories))+geom_point()+ ggtitle("Calories Burned depending on the Steps taken")

Activity <- merge(Activity,Sleep_Day,by="Id")
colnames(Activity)

Activity <- Activity %>%
  mutate(DistanceCategory= case_when(
    Activity$TotalDistance < 4500 ~ "LowActive",
    Activity$TotalDistance >= 5000 & .$TotalDistance < 6000 ~ "AverageActive",
    Activity$TotalDistance >= 6500 & .$TotalDistance < 7000 ~ "MorethanAverageActive",
    Activity$TotalDistance > 7500 ~ "VeryActive"
  ))
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = Activity)+
  geom_col(mapping = aes(Sleep_Amount, y= Calories, fill =Sleep_Amount))+
  facet_grid(~DistanceCategory)+
  labs(title = "How much Calories burns affecting by Sleep Quality By Distance Categories")+
  theme(axis.text = element_text(angle = 45))
```

### Observations-
we can see the smart device works very well on sleep data and calories burned


```{r}
ggplot(data = Activity)+
  geom_col(mapping = aes(Day_of_Week, y=TotalSteps, fill =Day_of_Week))+
  facet_grid(~DistanceCategory)+
  labs(title = "How much Steps taken on which day of week")+
  theme(axis.text = element_text(angle = 45))
```

Observations_ by data viz we can say on sunday there are less data for totalsteps taken due to holiday on tuesday again back to routine work so good steps are taken and on other days average steps are taken
