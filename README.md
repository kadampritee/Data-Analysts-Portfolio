 This repository is mainly for projects I have done under Coursera.

 Coursera's online Google Data Analytics Course prepares me for a career as a data analyst by helping me 
learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly
 communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Excel, R-language, SQL, Python, and its data 
analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib,seaborn,sklearn) as I build a portfolio of projects.

Tips: For data science projects with R, I would recommend you to install tidyverse, ggplot2, lubridate, 
tidyr, dplyr and lots more... these basic libraries.

The program prepares me for a career as a Data Analyst / Analytics professional by helping me learn:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
  - Data Wrangling.
  - Statistics/Central Tendency
  - Data Analysis.
  - Data Visualization.

Technical Skill Utilized:-
 
  - R-programming Language.
  - Data Analysis libraries of R(tidyverse,readr,dplyr,readxl).
  - Data Visualization libraries (ggplot2,GGally,Lattice,plotly).
  - IBM Watson Studio (R)

  About the data:-

 These datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey 
via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. 
Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal 
tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, 
heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by
 export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Variation 
between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers 
and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.
