## Visualizing data:
```{r}
ggplot(data=Activity,aes(x=TotalSteps,y=Calories,color=Calories))+geom_point()+ ggtitle("Calories Burned depending on the Steps taken")
```

```{r}
Activity <- merge(Activity,Sleep_Day,by="Id")
colnames(Activity)
```

```{r}
Activity <- Activity %>%
  mutate(DistanceCategory= case_when(
    Activity$TotalDistance < 4500 ~ "LowActive",
    Activity$TotalDistance >= 5000 & .$TotalDistance < 6000 ~ "AverageActive",
    Activity$TotalDistance >= 6500 & .$TotalDistance < 7000 ~ "MorethanAverageActive",
    Activity$TotalDistance > 7500 ~ "VeryActive"
  ))
```




```{r}
ggplot(data = Activity)+
  geom_col(mapping = aes(Sleep_Amount, y= Calories, fill =Sleep_Amount))+
  facet_grid(~DistanceCategory)+
  labs(title = "How much Calories burns affecting by Sleep Quality By Distance Categories")+
  theme(axis.text = element_text(angle = 45))
```

### Observations-
we can see the smart device works very well on sleep data and calories burned




Observations_ by data viz we can say on sunday there are less data for totalsteps taken due to holiday on tuesday again back to routine work so good steps are taken and on other days average steps are taken

### Recommendations:

The app which is made must have to update to track all the data which is needed from the smart devices.

So I would like to suggest the company must have to work on the app to get these information consistently and accurately.

Because the smart devices are rooted to the mobile to track the information from the consumers through the smart devices.

The age of the consumer not tracked so I would like to add the age data to this app to get accurate results.
